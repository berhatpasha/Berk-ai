# Berk-ai ( Discord Bot framework with python )

> ### How to compile it?
> 1) install the python interpreter and necessary python tools on your server or computer
> 2) To get started, install the necessary libraries on the server or on your own computer with the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command
> 3) Make the necessary edits (files such as bot messages, ai database, etc. are made for example... change them as you wish and organize them according to yourself)
> 4) Start the bot by running the `python3 berk-ai.py` command on the server where you compiled the bot or on your own computer

> ### Adaptation
> - Enter your token in the `discord_api_token` variable in **/database/database.py**
> - Again enter the id of the role that can use the bot under the `role.id` variable in **berk-ai.py line 143**
> - The Ai database is under **/database/aidatabase.json**... you can edit this file as in the example or let it auto-edit with training mode on.
> - Customize the rest of the program and translate it into the language of your choice
